## What is this class about?

-   For many years, social scientists uses text in their empirical analysis:

   - Close reading of documents.
   - Qualitative Analysis of interviews
   - Content Analysis
   
-   Digital Revolution:

    -   Production of text increased
    -   The computational capacity to analyze them at scale as well.
    -   Powerful computational models became easily accessible. 
-   This class covers methods (and many applications) of using Text as Data to [answer social science problems]{.red} and [test social science theories]{.red}

- But... with an modern flavor. 
   
   - Deep Learning Revolution / Large Language Models / Representation Learning. 

# Text Representation: From Sparse to Dense Vector

## Vector Space Model

To represent documents as numbers, we will use the [vector space model representation]{.red}:

-   A document $D_i$ is represented as a collection of features $W$ (words, tokens, n-grams..)

-   Each feature $w_i$ can be place in a real line, then a document $D_i$ is a point in a $W$ dimensional space

::: fragment
Imagine the sentence below: *"If that is a joke, I love it. If not, can't wait to unpack that with you later."*

-   **Sorted Vocabulary** =(a, can't, i, if, is, it, joke, later, love, not, that, to, unpack, wait, with, you")

-   **Feature Representation** = (1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)

-   Features will typically be the n-gram (mostly unigram) [frequencies]{.red} of the tokens in the document, or some [function]{.red} of those frequencies
:::

::: fragment
Now each document is now a vector (vector space model)

-   stacking these vectors will give you our workhose representation for text: [**Document Feature Matrix**]{.red}

## Visualizing Vector Space Model

In the vector space, we can use geometry to build well-defined comparison measures between the documents

## Vector Space Model vs Representation Learning

This vector space representation is super useful, and has been used in many many many applications in computational linguistics and social science applications of text-as-data. Including:

- Descriptive statistics of documents (count words, text-similarity, complexity, etc..)

- Supervised Machine Learning Models for Text Classification (DFM becomes the input of the models)

- Unsupervised Machine Learning (Topic Models & Clustering)

**But**... Embedded in this model, there is the idea we represent [words]{.red} as a [one-hot encoding]{.red}.

-   "cat": \[0,0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, ....., V\] , on a V dimensional vector
-   "dog": \[0,0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, ...., V\], on a V dimensional vector

**What these vectors look like?**

-   really sparse

-   those vectors are orthogonal

-   no natural notion of similarity

# How can we embed some notion of meaning in the way we represent words?

## Distributional Semantics

> "you shall know a word by the company it keeps." J. R. Firth 1957

[Distributional semantics]{.red}: words that are used in the same contexts tend to be similar in their meaning.

::: incremental
-   How can we use this insight to build a word representation?

    -   Move from sparse representation to dense representation

    -   Represent words as vectors of numbers with high number of dimensions

    -   Each feature on this vectors embeds some information from the word (gender? noun? sentiment? stance?)

    -   Learn this representation from the unlabeled data.
:::

## Sparse vs Dense Vectors

**One-hot encoding / Sparse Representation:**

-   cat = $\begin{bmatrix} 0,0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0 \end{bmatrix}$

-   dog = $\begin{bmatrix} 0,0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0 \end{bmatrix}$

**Word Embedding / Dense Representation:**

-   cat = $\begin{bmatrix} 0.25, -0.75, 0.90, 0.12, -0.50, 0.33, 0.66, -0.88, 0.10, -0.45 \end{bmatrix}$

-   dog = $\begin{bmatrix} 0.25, 1.75, 0.90, 0.12, -0.50, 0.33, 0.66, -0.88, 0.10, -0.45 \end{bmatrix}$

## Word Embeddings

**Encoding similarity:** vectors are not ortogonal anymore!

**Automatic Generalization:** learn about one word allow us to automatically learn about related words

**Encodes Meaning:** by learning the context, I can learn what a word means.

**As a consequence:**

-   Word Embeddings improves by ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE several Text-as-Data Tasks.

-   Allows to deal with unseen words.

-   Form the core idea of state-of-the-art models, such as LLMs.

# Introduction to Deep Learning

## Basics of Machine Learning

**Deep Learning** is a subfield of machine learning based on using neural networks models to learn.

As in any other statistical model, the goal of machine learning is to use data to learn about some output. 

$$ y = f(X) + \epsilon$$

- **Where:**

 -   $y$ is the outcome/dependent/response variable

 -   $X$ is a matrix of predictors/features/independent variables

 -   $f()$ is some fixed but unknown function mapping X to y. The "signal" in the data

 -   $\epsilon$ is some random error term. The "noise" in the data.


## Linear models (OLS)

The simplest model we can use is an linear model (the classic OLS regression)

$$ y = b_0 + WX + \epsilon$$

- Where: 

  - $W$ is a vector of dimension p, 
  - $X$ is the feature vector of dimension p
  - $b$ is a bias term (intercept)

## Using Matrix Algebra

$$\mathbf{W} = \begin{bmatrix} w_1 & w_2 & \dots & w_p\end{bmatrix}$$


$$\mathbf{X} = \begin{bmatrix} X_1 \\ X_2 \\ X_3 \\ \vdots \\ X_p \end{bmatrix}$$

With matrix multiplication:

$$\mathbf{W} \mathbf{X} + b = w_1 X_1 + w_2 X_2 + \dots + w_p X_p + b$$

## Logistic Regression

If we want to model some type of non-linearity, necessary for example when our outcome is binary, we can add a transformation function to make things non-linear:

$$ y = \sigma (b_0 + WX + \epsilon)$$

Where: 

$$ \sigma(b_0 + WX + \epsilon) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-b_0 + WX + \epsilon)}$$

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./figs/sigmoid.png") 
```

## Logistic Regression as a Neural Network

Let's assume we have a simple model of voting. We want to predict if individual $i$ will vote ($y=1$), and we will use four socio demographic factors to make this prediction. 

Classic statistical approach with logistic regression: 

$$ \hat{P(Y_i=1|X)} = \sigma(b_0 + WX + \epsilon) $$
We use MLE (Maximum Likelihood estimation) to find the parameters $W$ and $b_0$. We assume:

$$ Y_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\pi_i) $$

The likelihood function for $n$ independent observations is:

$$L(W, b_0) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} \pi_i^{y_i} (1 - \pi_i)^{1 - y_i}.$$

## Neural Networks

A **Neural Network** is equivalent to stacking multiple logistic regressions vertically and repeat this process multiple times across many layers.

As a Matrix, instead of: 

$$\mathbf{W}_{previous} = \begin{bmatrix} w_1 & w_2 & \dots & w_p\end{bmatrix}$$


We use this set of parameters: 

$$
\mathbf{W} = \begin{bmatrix} w_{11} & w_{12} & w_{13} & \dots & w_{1p} \\
                               w_{21} & w_{22} & w_{23} & \dots & w_{2p} \\
                               w_{31} & w_{32} & w_{33} & \dots & w_{3p} \\
                               \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
                               w_{k1} & w_{k2} & w_{k3} & \dots & w_{kp}
                \end{bmatrix}
$$                


## 

Then, every line becomes a different logistic regression

$$\mathbf{WX} = \begin{bmatrix}  \sigma(w_{11} X_1 + w_{12} X_2 + \dots + w_{1p}X_p) \\ \sigma(w_{21} X_1 + w_{22} X_2 + \dots + w_{2p}X_p) \\ \sigma(w_{31} X_1 + w_{32} X_2 + \dots + w_{3p}X_p )\\ \vdots \\ \sigma(w_{k1} X_1 + w_{k2} X_2 + \dots + w_{kp}X_p) \end{bmatrix}$$
We then combine all of those with another set of parameters: 

$$
\begin{align*}
    \mathbf{HA} &= h1 \cdot \sigma(w_{11} X_1 + w_{12} X_2 + \dots + w_{1p}X_p)\\
                &+ h_2\cdot \sigma(w_{21} X_1 + w_{22} X_2 + \dots + w_{2p}X_p)\\
                &+ h_3 \cdot \sigma (w_{31} X_1 + w_{32} X_2 + \dots + w_{3p}X_p)\\
                &+ \dots + h_k + \sigma(w_{k1} X_1 + w_{k2} X_2 + \dots + w_{kp}X_p)
\end{align*}
$$

## Feed Forward on a Deep Neural Network

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./figs/feed_forward.png") 
```

## Key Components 

- Input: p features (the original data) of an observation are linearly transformed into k1 features using a weight matrix of size k1×p

- Embedding Matrices: Paremeters you multiply your data by. 

- Neurons: Number of dimensions on your embedding matrices

- Hidden Layer: the transformation that consists of the linear transformation and an activation function

- Output Layer: the transformation that consists of the linear transformation and then (usually) a sigmoid (or some other activation function) to produce the final output predictions

## Let's take a step back! 

Weights matrices are just parameters... the $\beta_s$ of our regression models. 

- There are MANY of them!! Neural Networks are a black box!

- But... they also serve as way to project features (words) in a dense dimensional space.

- Remember: 

   - **One-hot encoding / Sparse Representation:**

      -   cat = $\begin{bmatrix} 0,0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0 \end{bmatrix}$

      -   dog = $\begin{bmatrix} 0,0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0 \end{bmatrix}$

   - **Word Embedding / Dense Representation:**

      -   cat = $\begin{bmatrix} 0.25, -0.75, 0.90, 0.12, -0.50, 0.33, 0.66, -0.88, 0.10, -0.45 \end{bmatrix}$

      -   dog = $\begin{bmatrix} 0.25, 1.75, 0.90, 0.12, -0.50, 0.33, 0.66, -0.88, 0.10, -0.45 \end{bmatrix}$


## Deep Neural Network for Textual Data

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./figs/nlp_nn.png") 
```


## Estimation: Gradient Descent

**Linear Regression**

$$\text{RSS} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \widehat{y}_i)^2 $$


**Logistic Regression**

$$L(\beta) = -\sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( y_i \log(\widehat{y}_i) + (1-y_i)\log(1 - \widehat{y}_i) \right)$$

**Fully-Connected Neural Network (Classification, Binary)**

$$L(\mathbf{W}) = -\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( y_i \log(\widehat{y}_i) + (1-y_i)\log(1 - \widehat{y}_i) \right)$$

This is called a binary cross entropy loss function

##


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./figs/loss.png") 
```


## Updating parameters

- Define a loss function

- Gradient Descent Algorithm: 

   - Initialize weights randomly
   
   - Feed Forward: Matrix Multiplication + Activation function
   
   - Get the loss for this iteration
   
   - Compute gradient (partial derivatives): $\frac{\partial J(\mathbf{W})}{\partial \mathbf{W}}$

   
   - Update weights: $W_{new}: W_{old} -\eta \cdot \frac{\partial J(\mathbf{W})}{\partial \mathbf{W}}$

   - Loop until convergence:
